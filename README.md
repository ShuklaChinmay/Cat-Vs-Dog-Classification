# Cat-Vs-Dog-Classification
The Cat vs. Dog Classification project is a fundamental deep learning task for beginners. In this project, we aim to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging the power of CNNs, we create an accurate and robust model capable of classifying cat and dog images with high precisionÂ¹.

Here are the key steps involved in building the classifier:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
   - We start by importing essential libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Keras, and scikit-learn.

2. Define image properties:
   - Set the image width, height, and channels (RGB).

3. Prepare the dataset for training:
   - Read the image files from the "dogs-vs-cats" dataset directory.
   - Label the images as either "dog" or "cat."

4. Create the neural network model:
   - Build a CNN architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout, and dense layers.
   - Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and the RMSprop optimizer.

5. Analyze the model:
   - Check the model summary to understand its architecture.

6. Define callbacks and learning rate:
   - Set up early stopping and learning rate reduction to improve training efficiency.

7. Manage the data:
   - Replace numeric labels with meaningful categories (e.g., 0 for "cat" and 1 for "dog").
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
